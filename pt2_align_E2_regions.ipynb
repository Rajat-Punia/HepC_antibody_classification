    "### Script summary (alignment of antigen–antibody complexes on E2 chain)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Align all antigen–antibody complex structures based on the **antigen (E2) chain**.\n",
    "- **Input:**  \n",
    "  - `input.csv` → contains `pdb_id, antigen_chain_id, heavy_chain_id, light_chain_id, antibody`.  \n",
    "  - Renumbered PDBs located in `pdb_files/`.\n",
    "- **Reference:**  \n",
    "  - The **first PDB’s antigen chain** is used as the reference for alignment.\n",
    "- **Method:**  \n",
    "  - Uses `tmtools.tm_align` to superimpose each structure’s antigen onto the reference.  \n",
    "  - Applies the resulting transformation to the full antigen–antibody complex.\n",
    "- **Output:**  \n",
    "  - Aligned structures saved in `aligned_structures_E2/` as  \n",
    "    `aligned_<pdbid>_<antigen>_<heavy>_<light>.pdb`.\n"
